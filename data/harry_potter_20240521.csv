Rowling says that Harry and Dudley would ""stay on Christmas card"" terms for the rest of their lives,[7] and that Harry would take his family to visit Dudley's when they were in the neighbourhood, but it was something that James Sirius, Albus Severus and Lily Luna ""would dread"".[8] However, Dudley's kids and Harry's occasionally would ""get together while the adults sat in awkward silence"". In Harry Potter and the Cursed Child it is also mentioned that adult Dudley sent Harry his baby blanket, one of the two surviving possession of Harry's from his parents. Dudley is portrayed by Harry Melling in the Harry Potter films. Melling had to wear a fat suit, as he lost a considerable amount of weight as the films progressed.[9]",NA,0

"66","Gellert Grindelwald (/ˈɡrɪndəlˌvɔːld, -ˌwɔːld/)","Dark wizard who was jailed after Albus Dumbledore defeated him in the 1940s","Rowling claimed at a Q&A session that she implied Dumbledore being once in love with Grindelwald, and thus he had 'lost his moral compass,' but she did not say whether those feelings were returned.[13][14] In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1, young Grindelwald is portrayed by Jamie Campbell Bower[15] while the older Grindelwald is played by Michael Byrne. Grindelwald appears in the Fantastic Beasts film series, portrayed by Johnny Depp in the first two films.[16] In the film series storyline, Grindelwald and Dumbledore have made a blood pact in their youth to never harm each other which Grindelwald sports in a vial while seeking a means to indirectly kill his former lover. He first appears in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, though he is disguised for most of the story as the American Auror Percival Graves, played by Colin Farrell, while seeking out an Obscurus whom he learned to be Credence Barebone. In Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, Grindelwald manages to manipulate both Credence and Queenie Goldstein to his side by promising the former he will tell him who he really is (supposedly Aurelius Dumbledore, a long lost brother to Albus and Aberforth) and the latter that she will be free to marry her No-Maj fiancé, Jacob Kowalski. Campbell Bower reprises his role as the teenaged version of the character in a brief flashback scene as well. In November 2020, Depp resigned from the role at the request of Warner Bros. due to his personal legal troubles.[17] Later that month, it was reported that Mads Mikkelsen was in early talks to replace Depp as Grindelwald for the third film.[18] On 25 November 2020, Warner Bros. officially announced that Mikkelsen would replace Depp.[19] On replacing Depp, Mikkelsen noted that it would be a ""creative suicide"" to copy Depp's ""masterful"" portrayal as Grindelwald, having developed his own take on the character, and admitted that a ""bridge"" should be needed between Depp's performance and his own,[20] having been a fan of Depp since his early films.[21]",NA,0
